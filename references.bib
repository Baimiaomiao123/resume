   abstract = {Chemoresistance is a major obstacle in the clinical management of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa). It is imperative to develop novel strategies to overcome chemoresistance and improve clinical outcomes in patients who have failed chemotherapy. Using a two-tier phenotypic screening platform, we identified bromocriptine mesylate as a potent and selective inhibitor of chemoresistant PCa cells. Bromocriptine effectively induced cell cycle arrest and activated apoptosis in chemoresistant PCa cells but not in chemoresponsive PCa cells. RNA-seq analyses revealed that bromocriptine affected a subset of genes implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle, DNA repair, and cell death. Interestingly, approximately one-third (50/157) of the differentially expressed genes affected by bromocriptine overlapped with known p53-p21- retinoblastoma protein (RB) target genes. At the protein level, bromocriptine increased the expression of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and affected several classical and non-classical dopamine receptor signal pathways in chemoresistant PCa cells, including adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), nuclear factor kappa B  (NF-κB), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), and survivin. As a monotherapy, bromocriptine treatment at 15 mg/kg, three times per week, via the intraperitoneal route significantly inhibited the skeletal growth of chemoresistant C4-2B-TaxR xenografts in athymic nude mice. In summary, these results provided the first preclinical evidence that bromocriptine is a selective and effective inhibitor of chemoresistant PCa. Due to its favorable clinical safety profiles, bromocriptine could be rapidly tested in PCa patients and repurposed as a novel subtype-specific treatment to overcome chemoresistance.},

   abstract = {Stressful events activate the amygdala and a network of associated brain regions. Studies in both humans and rodents indicate that noradrenaline has a prominent role in this activation. Noradrenaline induces a hypervigilant state that helps to remember the event. This mnemonic effect is enhanced when the situation is so stressful that substantial amounts of corticosteroids are released and reach the amygdala. The combination of the two hormones leads to optimal strengthening of contacts and thus memory. Yet, rises in corticosteroid levels that are not precisely synchronized with noradrenaline release do not act synergistically but rather prevent or suppress the effect of noradrenaline. This dynamic interaction illustrates the adaptive and potentially protective capacity of corticosteroids regarding traumatic memories.},

   abstract = {Stress as a modern civilization factor significantly affects our lives. While acute stress might have a positive effect on the organism, chronic stress is usually detrimental and might lead to serious health complications. It is known that stress induced by the physical environment (temperature-induced cold stress) can significantly impair the efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapies and the anti-tumor immune response. On the other hand, epidemiological evidence has shown that patients taking drugs known as β-adrenergic antagonists ("β-blockers"), which are commonly prescribed to treat arrhythmia, hypertension, and anxiety, have significantly lower rates of several cancers. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about catecholamines as important stress hormones in tumorigenesis and discuss the use of β-blockers as the potential therapeutic agents.},

   abstract = {Catecholamines stimulate epithelial proliferation, but the role of sympathetic nerve signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is poorly understood. Catecholamines promoted ADRB2-dependent PDAC development, nerve growth factor (NGF) secretion, and pancreatic nerve density. Pancreatic Ngf overexpression accelerated tumor development in LSL-Kras(+/G12D);Pdx1-Cre (KC) mice. ADRB2 blockade together with gemcitabine reduced NGF expression and nerve density, and increased survival of LSL-Kras(+/G12D);LSL-Trp53(+/R172H);Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice. Therapy with a Trk inhibitor together with gemcitabine also increased survival of KPC mice. Analysis of PDAC patient cohorts revealed a correlation between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, nerve density, and increased survival of patients on nonselective beta-blockers. These findings suggest that catecholamines drive a feedforward loop, whereby upregulation of neurotrophins increases sympathetic innervation and local norepinephrine accumulation.},

   abstract = {Mental health profoundly impacts inflammatory responses in the body. This is particularly apparent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in which psychological stress is associated with exacerbated disease flares. Here, we discover a critical role for the enteric nervous system (ENS) in mediating the aggravating effect of chronic stress on intestinal inflammation. We find that chronically elevated levels of glucocorticoids drive the generation of an inflammatory subset of enteric glia that promotes monocyte- and TNF-mediated inflammation via CSF1. Additionally, glucocorticoids cause transcriptional immaturity in enteric neurons, acetylcholine deficiency, and dysmotility via TGF-beta2. We verify the connection between the psychological state, intestinal inflammation, and dysmotility in three cohorts of IBD patients. Together, these findings offer a mechanistic explanation for the impact of the brain on peripheral inflammation, define the ENS as a relay between psychological stress and gut inflammation, and suggest that stress management could serve as a valuable component of IBD care.},

   abstract = {Activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) drives breast cancer progression in preclinical breast cancer models, but it has yet to be established if neoplastic and stromal cells residing in the tumor are directly targeted by locally released norepinephrine (NE). In murine orthotopic and spontaneous mammary tumors, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ sympathetic nerves were limited to the periphery of the tumor. No TH+ staining was detected deeper within these tumors, even in regions with a high density of blood vessels. NE concentration was much lower in tumors compared to the more densely innervated spleen, reflecting the relative paucity of tumor TH+ innervation. Tumor and spleen NE concentration decreased with increased tissue mass. In mice treated with the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to selectively destroy sympathetic nerves, tumor NE concentration was reduced approximately 50%, suggesting that the majority of tumor NE is derived from local sympathetic nerves. To evaluate NE utilization, NE turnover in orthotopic 4T1 mammary tumors was compared to spleen under baseline and stress conditions. In non-stressed mice, NE turnover was equivalent between tumor and spleen. In mice exposed to a stressor, tumor NE turnover was increased compared to spleen NE turnover, and compared to non-stressed tumor NE turnover. Together, these results demonstrate that NE in mammary tumors is derived from local sympathetic nerves that synthesize and metabolize NE. However, differences between spleen and tumor NE turnover with stressor exposure suggest that sympathetic NE release is regulated differently within the tumor microenvironment compared to the spleen. Local mammary tumor sympathetic innervation, despite its limited distribution, is responsive to stressor exposure and therefore can contribute to stress-induced tumor progression.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Pituitary adenomas are neoplasms of the pituitary adenohypophyseal cell lineage and include functioning tumors, characterized by the secretion of pituitary hormones, and nonfunctioning tumors. Clinically evident pituitary adenomas occur in approximately 1 in 1100 persons. OBSERVATIONS: Pituitary adenomas are classified as either macroadenomas (≥10 mm) (48% of tumors) or microadenomas (<10 mm). Macroadenomas may cause mass effect, such as visual field defects, headache, and/or hypopituitarism, which occur in about 18% to 78%, 17% to 75%, and 34% to 89% of patients, respectively. Thirty percent of pituitary adenomas are nonfunctioning adenomas, which do not produce hormones. Functioning tumors are those that produce an excess of normally produced hormones and include prolactinomas, somatotropinomas, corticotropinomas, and thyrotropinomas, which produce prolactin, growth hormone, corticotropin, and thyrotropin, respectively. Approximately 53% of pituitary adenomas are prolactinomas, which can cause hypogonadism, infertility, and/or galactorrhea. Twelve percent are somatotropinomas, which cause acromegaly in adults and gigantism in children, and 4% are corticotropinomas, which secrete corticotropin autonomously, resulting in hypercortisolemia and Cushing disease. All patients with pituitary tumors require endocrine evaluation for hormone hypersecretion. Patients with macroadenomas additionally require evaluation for hypopituitarism, and patients with tumors compressing the optic chiasm should be referred to an ophthalmologist for formal visual field testing. For those requiring treatment, first-line therapy is usually transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, except for prolactinomas, for which medical therapy, either bromocriptine or cabergoline, is usually first line. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Clinically manifest pituitary adenomas affect approximately 1 in 1100 people and can be complicated by syndromes of hormone excess as well as visual field defects and hypopituitarism from mass effect in larger tumors. First-line therapy for prolactinomas consists of bromocriptine or cabergoline, and transsphenoidal pituitary surgery is first-line therapy for other pituitary adenomas requiring treatment.},
