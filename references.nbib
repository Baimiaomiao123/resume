AB  - The nervous system regulates tissue stem and precursor populations throughout 
      life. Parallel to roles in development, the nervous system is emerging as a 
      critical regulator of cancer, from oncogenesis to malignant growth and metastatic 
      spread. Various preclinical models in a range of malignancies have demonstrated 
      that nervous system activity can control cancer initiation and powerfully 
      influence cancer progression and metastasis. Just as the nervous system can 
      regulate cancer progression, cancer also remodels and hijacks nervous system 
      structure and function. Interactions between the nervous system and cancer occur 
      both in the local tumour microenvironment and systemically. Neurons and glial 
      cells communicate directly with malignant cells in the tumour microenvironment 
      through paracrine factors and, in some cases, through neuron-to-cancer cell 
      synapses. Additionally, indirect interactions occur at a distance through 
      circulating signals and through influences on immune cell trafficking and 
      function. Such cross-talk among the nervous system, immune system and cancer-both 
      systemically and in the local tumour microenvironment-regulates pro-tumour 
      inflammation and anti-cancer immunity. Elucidating the neuroscience of cancer, 
      which calls for interdisciplinary collaboration among the fields of neuroscience, 
      developmental biology, immunology and cancer biology, may advance effective 
      therapies for many of the most difficult to treat malignancies.
